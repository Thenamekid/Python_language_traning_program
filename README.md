# Python_language_traning_program

Welcome to the language traning program! This Python program allows you to test your knowledge of words in a foreign language and their translations.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Open the script in your preferred code editor.

3. You can customize the following variables in the script:

   - `language`: Set the language you want to be displayed during the quiz.
   - `words` and `facits`: Customize the list of words and their translations that you want to be quizzed on. Make sure the order of words and translations in both lists corresponds to each other.

4. Run the script (`Python_language_traning_program.py`) and start the quiz.

## How It Works

- The script will randomly select a word from the list and prompt you to provide the translation in the specified language.

- If your answer is correct, the script will provide feedback and move on to the next word.

- If your answer is incorrect, the script will show you the correct translation and track errors.

- Once you've gone through all the words, the quiz will restart, and the error count will reset.


Enjoy learning and have fun with your language quiz!
